### My name is Tenieya Craig. I'm a student at FWCS Career Academy in a Software Development class. I am currently leanring how to use Python as my course of coding. I don't have any work experience or working on any projects right now. A personal thing about me is that I have a hearing impairment on my right ear. I am completely deaf out of that ear and could only hear in my left ear. My hobbies are mostly video games, writing, drawing, and puzzles.
