## My name is Tenieya Craig. I'm a student at FWCS Career Academy in a Software Development class. I am also a student from R. Nelson Snider. I am currently using Python as my course of coding. I don't have any work experience or working on any projects right now. Some of my interests are video games, wirting, and learning how to code. A personal thing about me is that I have a hearing impairment on my right ear. I am completely deaf out of that ear and could only hear in my left ear.
